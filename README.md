## Quick Cinema Project for a Wunderman's technical challenge

### Tech used:
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- TailwindCSS for styling
- React Query for easier and cleaner data fetching and data handling
- Pulled movies and their information from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wtuydev/test-json/main/films.json
- Another good API option for movies is [The Movie Database ]((https://www.themoviedb.org/))
- And obviously Git :)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
