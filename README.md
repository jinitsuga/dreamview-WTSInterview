## Quick Cinema Project for a Wunderman's technical challenge
#### Built in 2 days
### Tech used:
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- TailwindCSS for styling
- React Query for easier and cleaner data fetching and data handling
- Pulled movies and their information from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wtuydev/test-json/main/films.json
- Another good API option for movies is [The Movie Database ]((https://www.themoviedb.org/))
- And obviously Git :)
